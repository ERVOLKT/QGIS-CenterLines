# CenterLines QGIS plugin [experimental and not yet useful]

This is merely a sample to get into developing Python QGIS plugins. My aim is to create a network of lines connecting given points, to interact with some GUI elements and Qgis Objects.

It is based on this tutorial by Ujaval Gandhi, using the plugin-builder-plugin [qgis python plugin tutorial](http://www.qgistutorials.com/en/docs/building_a_python_plugin.html)

Please feel free to use and try out, but don't expect too much sense in it!
