# CenterLines QGIS plugin [experimental, slightly useful]

This is merely a sample to get into developing Python QGIS plugins. My aim is to create a network of lines connecting given points, to interact with some GUI elements and Qgis Objects.

It is based on [this](http://www.qgistutorials.com/en/docs/building_a_python_plugin.html) tutorial by Ujaval Gandhi, using the plugin-builder-plugin 

Please feel free to use and try out, but don't expect too much sense in it!
